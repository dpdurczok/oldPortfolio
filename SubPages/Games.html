					Entrapped in a strange facility, you find your way to the exit through the use of shadows - creating blocks from nothing and entrances where there would otherwise be none. 
					<br> <br>
					All you have is Emmett, your happy-go-lucky Companion Cube (Not to be confused with Portal's CC). As you make your way out, you begin to question what's real. 
					Can you beat it?
